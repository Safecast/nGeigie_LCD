V1.2.5 is with LCD display. Setup information will be loaded from SD card.  
Basic logging of CPM is done. No timestamping yet. 

On startup if SD card is detected the display displays the version number. No version number no valid SD card. 
If a IP is assigned to the ethernet card through DHCP, the display shows "setup OK".
After about 5 minutes a reading of the sensor should show. If it is 0 uS/H the sensor is not connected. 
After about 10 minutes the first data is send and a message on the display should read "send OK".

Based on work done by Kalin, Lionel and Robin
